    "There are some repetitivetweets. This is because one person repeats a tweet (or very similar tweets that)many times in some days for emphasis or other reasons like reporting weather.\n",

    "*Clustering for sentence embeddingworks good when we have few words in the sentence (like: fire tonight)\n",
    "\n",
    "*Sentence embedding works wellwith specific words in the sentence (like Australia and their cities) but itdoes not mean that all tweets about Australia are in one cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Sentence embedding works goodfor sentences with many similar words in each tweet.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Stemming (which we use incleaning) is not good for some words. For example, for “business” the stemmingalgorithm gives “busi” while the embedding algorithm does not recognize thisword and consider it as bus+i. Therefore, although on one hand, stemming convertsdifferent derivatives of one word to one word, on the other hand, maybe theembedding algorithm does not recognize that word so the embedding for that wordis not much semantic. As I studied this problem exists in some stemming algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Regarding fast algorithmsfor big data clustering, usually kmeans is the fastest (some implementations ofit have time complexity of O(n). But the problem is that it needs a number ofclusters in advance. Then dbscan clustering with time complexity O(n * log n)has been used too. Hierarchical clustering for big data has also been used butit has this problem we do not know where to cut the from the top and bottom ofthe dendrogram. (It should be done manually).\n",
    "\n",
    "*For the mng set, first Iused optics clustering algorithm but it did not finish. I used dbscan forclustering. With bdscan, which needs one more parameter that needs knowledge ofdata, the time for clustering was different. The code was run for threedifferent pairs of parameters. Nevertheless, the result is not good for all ofthem since most of the data are in the noise cluster or in one cluster. One time itdid not finish even after 1 day. The next time it finished after 5.5 hours withone pair of parameters (87 clusters + 1 noise cluster). Almost all of the tweetsclustered as noise. I changed the parameters. It finished after 7.5 hours (100cluster + 1 noise cluster), about most of the tweets were in one cluster and most ofthe remaining were in noise clusters. With other parameters, it took 5 mins! (271clusters + noise cluster). But again, almost all of the tweets were clusteredas noise. So, for all three cases, there are many tweets in the noise cluster ormany tweets in one cluster. Other clusters have usually less than 10 tweets,mostly around 5 tweets and usually none of them were related to management. It meansall related tweets are in cluster 0 which is useless.  \n",
    "\n",
    "*For ent set, I used kmeanswith 50, 100 and 1000 clusters. Number of members in each cluster is morerational. One way to find beliefs is to find clusters that have most usage ofentrepreneur. Then, frequent words in these clusters can be related to beliefs.This method seems good if each tweet is reduced to some few words and theembedding is fully semantic. Of course, it does not mean that clusters withoutthis word are not relevant, but for first try let us assume this. Since we mayhave many words in each tweet and the embedding is not very semantic, in almostall of the clusters we have this word for three cases (50 , 100, 1000clusters). For 1000 clusters, I found 20 most frequent words from 5 clustersthat have the most usage of entrepreneur. As it is seen from the result, somewords are not related, some can be beliefs like tech (technology), invest(investment), innov (innovation),..... Some words cannot be meaningful alonelike human or learn. Finding clustering by words is not complete (even if wesuppose that embedding is 100% semantic which is not). For example, if we havea tweet about “customer satisfaction is important”. By separate word clusteringamong all words of all tweets, we may find just “customer” which is useless orwe may find “satisfaction” which is incomplete: satisfaction of what?customers, employees, …. so, working on words individually does not seemperfect although for the first try it is good.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Regarding different timefor dbscan and kmeans (although the number of data is fixed), I think the timeof these algorithms can be dependent on other parameters and also it is relatedto my laptop that is running some codes simultaneously, which makes my laptop slow. \n",
    "\n",
    "*We need reducingunnecessary words, and getting abstract features in the sentences to havebetter results. "
